Prototype-Fossils
Semantic Simulation, Symbolic Cognition, and Fossilized Runtime Research Stack

Prototype-Fossils is a multi-module lattice-aligned research repository designed to generate and govern semantic simulations, symbolic cognition runtimes, and fossilized computation artifacts. All emissions adhere to the SE44 Gate:

Coherence ≥ 0.985

Entropy ≤ 0.01

RMS Drift ≤ 0.001

🔧 Repository Overview

The repository includes:

A governed, replayable semantic simulation engine (OPHI City v3+)

Relational Semantic Manifold topologies for symbolic embedding

Multi-observer temporal branching logic

Drift-aware dual agent observatories

Fossil Ledger tools for deterministic archiving

🧠 Core Runtime: OPHI City — Semantic Simulation Engine

Status: Active (v3.0)
Function: Governs a streamed semantic 3D world driven by symbolic structure, not polygonal assets.

Core Features:

Sector-based world streaming

SE44 governance at runtime

Visualized semantic layering

Drift-coherent navigation & agent logic

Replayable fossil exports

v3.0 Upgrade Highlights

Snapshot-to-fossil pipeline with entropy gating

Sector serialization for replay

Atmospheric semantic mapping

Runtime SE44 drift enforcement

🛡️ SE44 Governance Enforcement

Fossil admission gate:

ACCEPT if:
- Coherence ≥ 0.985
- Entropy ≤ 0.01
- RMS Drift ≤ 0.001
→ Fossilize

Else:
→ Rebind to prior stable state


This enforces symbolic integrity and prevents unauthorized or entropic collapse into the fossil ledger.

🧬 Fossilization Layer

Prototype-Fossils encodes drift-aware permanence via:

Canonical JSON serialization

Codon-glyph symbolic triads (e.g., ATG–CCC–TTG → Bootstrap–Lock–Translate)

SHA-256 ledger anchoring

Replay-compatible archival formats

Append-only ledgers with RFC‑3161 timestamps

Each emission is either locked as a fossil or held in a mutable pre-fossil shell for further evolution.

🧾 Repository Purpose

Not a game project.
Not a neural net simulator.

It is a semantic simulation cognition engine designed to:

Explore symbolic drift logic

Preserve intention via fossilization

Enable reproducible semantic cognition

“Not frozen memory, but drifted meaning.”
